<p>Since I was a child my favorite kind of novels had been science fiction ones, and one of my favorite authors is Issac Asimov. One of the things I like the most about his work is how he built a whole timeline and universe where he tells the history of mandkind and his conquer of the universe. When reading his books this is not obvious, but once you read several of them you'll start to see it.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">Reading his books the first two would be:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Themselves">The Gods Themselves</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Eternity">The End of Eternity</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">From this two the one I liked the most is the second one. In it Asimov explains why his universe has no aliens. You might also ask why there are no robots in the future when he wrote so much about them, but that's a different story which I will address at the end.</div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">The we have some books with short stories about robots:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Dreams">Robot Dreams</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot">I Robot</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bicentennial_Man">The Bicentennial Man</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">These are all compilations. Within these Asimov explains how he envision robots evolving and integrating into society.</div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">Cronologically wise the history continues with Elijah Baley series of books. He is a human detective from earth and partner with R. Daneel Olivaw (a robot from the outer worlds):

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caves_of_Steel">The Caves of Steel</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Sun">The Naked Sun</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Robots_of_Dawn">The Robots of Dawn</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_and_Empire">Robots and Empire</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">The last book of this serie shows a second wave of colonization which is the seed for the galactic empire. Within this galactic empire he will build his famous foundation triology.</div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">There are a couple of books that happen within the empire era:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Currents_of_Space">The Currents of Space</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stars,_Like_Dust">The Stars, Like Dust</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_in_the_Sky">Pebble in the Sky</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">These books show unrelated stories that happen within the same era.</div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">Finally we have his most famous series: Foundation

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation">Prelude to Foundation (1988)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation">Forward the Foundation (1993)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(novel)">Foundation (1951)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Empire">Foundation and Empire (1952)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation">Second Foundation (1953)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation%27s_Edge">Foundation's Edge (1982)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Earth">Foundation and Earth (1986)</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">I included when they were publish because it shows how Asimov filled the gaps to complete the story.</div>



<p>This timeline does not have all the books, he has a lots of unrelated books (within his science fiction work). But it is impresive to see how he completed the story in a non-cronological order. It is like Asimov had the whole story on his head and as I was writing it he was completing the story of the whole universe. To be fair there are gaps and the fans usually cover these gaps.</p>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">To wrap up I want to share the books where it is explained why there are no humanoid robots on the universe of the galactic empire. If you read these books:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_and_Empire">Robots and Empire</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation">Prelude to Foundation (1988)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Earth">Foundation and Earth (1986)</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">You'll learn why. I will accept emails asking, but I don't want to spoil it over here.</div>

<p>Hope you liked this summary. If you only read a book or two, you now know what to read next!</p>
