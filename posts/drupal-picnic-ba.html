<p>It's been a long time since our <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/8877">last camp was done on BsAs (2009)</a> and thanks to the inspiration of <a href="http://www.nachodigital.com.ar/es/content/primer-drupalcamp-santiagochile">Drupal Camp Chile</a> we've been planning doing another for a while.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>We finally put a day thanks to a visit from <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/enzo">Enzo</a>. We are calling it a "PicNic" and not a camp due to the extend it'll have, it will be two days:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On Saturday 22nd we'll have an sprint with mentoring</li>
	<li>On Monday 24th there will be technical conferences</li>
</ul>
