<p>We have a business project with my wife and had trouble deciding whether it had potential or not. We decided to participate on a local program/competition for entrepreneurs called <a href="http://www.iae.edu.ar/pi/centros/Entrepreneurship/Paginas/NAVES.aspx">Naves</a>. During that course we met a lot of people, learned a lot about entrepreneurship and got a method for evaluating projects.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>I want to continue saying that this article makes references to lots of sources in Spanish, and the most interesting thing about it is including the <a href="http://endeavor.org/entrepreneurs/santiago-bilinkis/51">Santiago Bilinkis</a> view about the process, fears & wrong ideas. I don't feel I should translate his articles, so I will only attempt to keep the check list and rough idea of what this article is about in spanish.</p>

<p>In a nutshell what you will need to do your best to fill a document called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_plan">Business plan</a>. It is a time demanding task and it will trigger lots of questions you did not think about. But in the process of filling it out you'll learn a lot about your project and how viable it is to become a real business. Something also useful is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">Business Model Canvas</a>. This is less demanding, and not so clear in some senses but it helps too.</p>


<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">I like lots of the articles of Santiago Bilinkis and they cover a wide ground as:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="http://spanish.bilinkis.com/2009/07/las-tres-mentiras-y-el-miedo-a-arriesgar/">Three lies and the fear of risk (spanish)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://spanish.bilinkis.com/2009/04/idea-robada/">Stolen idea (spanish)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://spanish.bilinkis.com/2009/03/fracasar-no-cuesta-nada/">Failing is free (spanish)</a></li>

</ul></div>

<div class="blog-text-after-item-list">But the ones I liked the most and I appreciate for evaluating your business project is his view of producing a modeling framework for your project using only an spreadsheet. The idea is to put all the different numbers of your business, connecting them all together and ending up with a big <a href="http://spanish.bilinkis.com/2009/04/modelando-un-negocio/">spreadsheet that lets you model the impact</a> of them on your business (article also on spanish).</div>


<p>And I want to wrap up the article with a reference to a concept. Before going to look for investors you should have a working model, to achieve that and do not spend all your saving in it you will want to follow the <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">Lean Startup</a>. After you filled your business plan, and if you are still convince it is a good idea, this will let you find the best way to start.</p>
