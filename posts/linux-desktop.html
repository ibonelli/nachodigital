.. description: Linux Desktop review after GNOME 3 release
.. category: Professional
-->

<p>I have a long history with Linux, I started on 1995. When on 2013 GNOME moved to its 3.x version & Ubuntu decided to use as desktop Unity (instead of GNOME 2.x as it did before) y felt betrayed (not just me, but the whole community using GNOME).</p>

<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">I guess I should start explaining that a big difference between MacOSX/Windows and Linux is the fact that you can choose what desktop to use. I will start describing some of what's on the menu:

<ul class="blog-item-list">

    <li>GNOME 2.x</li>

    <li><a href="http://mate-desktop.org/">MATE (It is a live and kicking fork of GNOME 2.x)</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell">GNOME 3.x (and its shells)</a></li>

    <li>KDE 3.5 and below</li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Plasma_Workspaces">KDE 4.x and above</a> (Used by Kubuntu)</li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28entorno_de_escritorio%29">Unity</a> (Used by default in Ubuntu)</li>

    <li><a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> (Used by default in Debian)</li>

</ul></div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">After GNOME 3.x arrival's and it's radical change to the desktop we got the possibility of using different graphical shells:

<ul class="blog-item-list">

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_%28software%29">Cinnamon</a> (Main <a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> desktop)</li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Panel">GNOME fallback (Similar to GNOME 2.x)</a></li>

</ul></div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">And we also have another piece, the windows manager:

<ul class="blog-item-list">

    <li>KWin: Used by KDE, and trying to <a href="http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2013/11/kwin-a-solution-for-non-kde-based-desktop-environments/">break free</a> from KDE dependencies.</li>

    <li>Compiz: This was an independent effort, then it's main developer was enlisted by ubuntu but it's now adrift</li>

    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>: This is a classic, simple and solid window manager.</li>

</ul></div>



<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">And to complete the world we live in we have distributions:

<ul class="blog-item-list-with-ending">

    <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/about">Debian</a>: My favorite! It could be a little harsh with you some times, but I still like it. I love it's open spirit, resilency...</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>: I did like it more before Unity, but in any case it is still a recognized leader. With its "clones" <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> and <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a>) it still has a nice side to it.</li>

    <li><a href="http://linuxmint.com/">LinuxMint</a>: If you ask me this was the only winner with Ubuntu's move towards Unity. It has different desktops by default. The two that I value the most from them are:</li>

    <ul>

        <li><a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/">Cinnamon</a>: This one will make you feel like home if you come from Windows</li>

        <li><a href="http://mate-desktop.org/">MATE</a>: A gateway from GNOME 3.x, will let you keep running GNOME 2.x and still have security updates.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>With RedHat move to corporate we got <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> as their open-source options.</li>

    <li>And a couple really small: <a href="http://www.slax.org/">Slax</a> (218MB w/KDE), <a href="http://puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> (161 MB) and <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">DSL</a> (50MB)</li>

</ul></div><div class="blog-text-after-item-list">I'm leaving a lot of distributions outside of this list (even big ones), but I would rather be brief. In any case I want to share a link to <a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">DistroWatch</a> which is a great place to learn about different distributions and trends.</div>


<p>To be honest I've always been annoyed by being pushed into changing my desktop. I did not like that when I used windows, and I felt like using Linux was a way to avoid that. Even windows always had a way to fallback.</p>


<p>On the other hand I've always chosen GNOME over KDE due to being less complex, open from the start (I refer to QT libraries different licenses). I used GNOME for a long time, and when I needed something lighter I would use Openbox instead. But Openbox is not really a desktop, so I always felt more comfortable on GNOME.</p>


<p>I also resisted KDE (and the QT libraries) for a long time. But my job as a teacher and the movement from GNOME 2.x to GNOME 3.x left me stranded. I tried using LXDE and I must say I like it. But on the end I felt like I wanted to have a MacOSX machine instead of Linux.</p>


<p>Finally I decided to try to configure KDE so it would work the way I wanted. To do that I had to find a way to avoid the <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Plasma_Workspaces">Plasma Desktop</a>, it turned out to be really simple to do that. I end up finding myself charmed by a VERY flexible, strong and stable system. Thanks to current machines speed and memory it does run smoothly and I managed to configure it so it would like as close as it can get to what I was used to. I no longer feel I need a MacOSX machine (in part thanks to <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin">KWin</a> windows manager) and I found myself using a very stable/mature system that has an stable version within Debian repositories.</p>


<p>I still love LXDE and Openbox as light weight options. If I weren't so fond of Debian I guess Linux Mint running MATE would a good choice... But I finally got a Desktop setup I feel comfortable with: <b>KDE</b>. It takes a little of work, but it is worth it. I must accept that KDE has a lot of advantages and they are much more respecful of their community.</p>


<p>2015 Jan update - While reading an article about <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-open-source-software-for-serious-linux-users/">most used software on the Linux community</a> I realized there is another BIG contestant that I did not include in this list: <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> (A light weigth widely use by the community). I tried it and it looks good, but it will need more testing and I doubt it will be as flexible as KDE. For what I've seen and read it seems to be on the same bucket as LXDE: Lightweight, good support, limited features.</p>

<p>2020 April update - Found a very good article which focus on used memory: <a href="https://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/a-memory-comparison-of-light-linux-desktops/">A Memory Comparison of Light Linux Desktops</a></p>
