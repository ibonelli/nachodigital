<p>The <a href="https://www.thersa.org/video/animates">royal society for the encouragement of arts</a> has a very good collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39BF9545D740ECFF">videos</a> which covers various subjects. For what I've seen so far I know I will watch most of them, but I want to share one about motivation.</p>

<p>Very good 10mins video/animation. In my opinion it is not only the subject what's interesting, but the way to tell it.</p>
