<p>I've been working with Wordpress, I work with Drupal, and I wanted to summarize a bit how to deal with Security in Wordpress.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div class="blog-text-with-item-list">In a nutshell:

<ul class="blog-item-list">

    <li>You can trust Wordpress core and need to keep up with updates (do upgrades as frequently as you can)</li>

    <li>You can not trust all plugins, you need check how secure, mature and professional they are</li>

</ul></div>

<p>There is no real comparisson, but this is a big difference Wordpress has with Drupal. Drupal's community takes care of the security of core and its modules.</p>

<p>Let's wrap up sharing an interesting (much longer) article on the subject from Smashing Magazine <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/09/four-malware-infections-wordpress/">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/09/four-malware-infections-wordpress/</a></p>
