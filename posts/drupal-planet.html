<p>Since <a href=http://www.nachodigital.com.ar/content/first-drupalcamp-santiagochile>Drupalcamp chile</a> I'm pushing <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2646968">with a bunch of nice people</a> an space within drupal.org to share content in spanish and portugues.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>We are almost ready, we just need to generate enough movement to make it public. Right now it exists, but it is not publicly available: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/planeta">drupal.org/planeta</a>.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this post was to share how to do it. So I will invite you to read the spanish version to read the steps and details. I see no reason to share them in english at this time. If there is interest I can do a full translation. Just leave a coment with your request.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
